# Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be stored as the object’s attributes. Use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve the pet’s name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.

name = input ("Enter the name of your pet: ")
